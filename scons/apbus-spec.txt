APBUS - internal bus.

Default baudrate: 115200 kbaud. Fall-back to 9600 kbaud.

Format: <pre-amble> <1B dst> <2B cmd> <2B length> <"length" bytes payload> <CS/CRC>

dst:
    0: PC/Master
    1-99: Node/CPU 1..99
    253: special msg (for instance init cmd)
    254: broadcast
    255: invalid

cmd:
    0x0000..0x00FF : protocol cmds
    0x0100..0x01FF : raw memory cmds (read/write raw memory etc)
    0x8000..0xFEFE : user/product specific cmds

states:
    a CPU can be in a few different states, partly controlled by the APBUS:
    0 : bootloader0 - in flash bootloader
    1 : bootloader1 - in ram bootloader
    2 : init - normal operation, but not finished initializing
    3 : normal - normal operation
    4 : config mode / read only - halted, not operation. Only read is allowed though.
    5 : config mode / rw - halted, not operation. read and write is allowed.
